## Machine Learning Features
Our application incorporates advanced machine learning technologies to enhance security and ensure the integrity of the ticket purchasing process:

- **ID Card Data Extraction**: Using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology, the application reads and extracts data from users' ID cards during registration. This ensures that the information provided is accurate and can be verified against official records.

- **Facial Recognition Verification**: The application uses facial recognition algorithms to verify the identity of the user. During registration, users take a selfie which is then compared to the photo on their ID card to ensure that they match. This prevents multiple accounts being created by the same person and ensures that each ticket is linked to a unique individual.
