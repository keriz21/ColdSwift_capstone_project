## Abstract

Indonesia has a serious concert ticket scalper and fraud problem. Ghisca Debora's case against a Coldplay concert with a loss of up to IDR 5.1 billion, another case in June 2023, which cost the victim around IDR 20.3 million, and a report in May 2023 about fraudulent concert ticket transactions through social media, with a loss of up to IDR 30 million.  This problem stems from event organizers not creating a strict system for giving tickets to buyers. To help solve this problem, we tried to create a responsive, secure, and innovative application that can reduce the practice of ticket scalpers, where ticket buyers will be identified using ID cards and faces so that each person can only buy one ticket. This app aims to create a fairer and safer environment for event fans to get tickets at a reasonable price, while reducing the harmful practice of ticket scalpers.  With this application, we hope to provide a solution to overcome the problems that often occur in the entertainment industry regarding the sale of event or show tickets.
