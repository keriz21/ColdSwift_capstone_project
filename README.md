# Ticket Sales Application

## What is this?
This is a ticket sales application, specifically for concert tickets. The application addresses an existing problem in the current ticketing system, where many people buy tickets in bulk and resell them at higher prices. Our solution is to implement a "one man one ticket" system, where each account can only purchase one ticket. Additionally, each person can only have one account, verified through their ID card.

## Background
Indonesia has a serious concert ticket scalper and fraud problem. Ghisca Debora's case against a Coldplay concert resulted in a loss of up to IDR 5.1 billion. Another case in June 2023 cost the victim around IDR 20.3 million, and a report in May 2023 detailed fraudulent concert ticket transactions through social media, with a loss of up to IDR 30 million. This problem stems from event organizers not creating a strict system for distributing tickets to buyers.

## Solution
To help solve this problem, we have created a responsive, secure, and innovative application that can reduce the practice of ticket scalping. Ticket buyers will be identified using ID cards and facial recognition so that each person can only buy one ticket. This app aims to create a fairer and safer environment for event fans to get tickets at a reasonable price while reducing the harmful practice of ticket scalping. With this application, we hope to provide a solution to overcome the common issues in the entertainment industry regarding event ticket sales.
